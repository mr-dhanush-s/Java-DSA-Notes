1. More than 1 reference variable can pointing to the single object



2. Any one of the reference variable will change the original object, then the original object is changed for all the reference variable.

- reference variable = object;
- name = "Michael"

## Memory and how the data is stored in the memory

**In future**, we will learn about pass by reference, pass by value in methods/functions which can done in python, c++

But in java We can pass the object by reference value.



### What happens when there is no reference variable to the object
- **Garbage Collection**
    - if the object doesn't have the reference variable then the garbage collection will removes.
    - **Memory management
**

**In future**,We can perform some functions when garbage collection hits
